Code128 is a tiny utility program that generates barcodes in CODE128
format (using the libgd graphics library to do the drawing.)

usage: code128 scale "text"

The barcode, by default, is an image 35 pixels high + however many pixels
wide it takes to encode the string.  You can make the barcode larger by
supplying a scale > 1.


To build, do
